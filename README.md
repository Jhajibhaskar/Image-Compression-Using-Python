# Image-Compression-Using-Python
First Run 'pip install pillow' in pycharm terminal to install required python library

In the Code 'Quality' of compressed image can be changed according to your required size , Here i set 40% quality means if input image size is 10mb then compressed image will be 4mb in size.

Compressed image will be saved as 'CompressedImage1.jpg' in the same folder in which code will be present.

If you want to compress more images one by one then just rename or move the previous compressed image because old compressed image will be replaced by new compressed image as filename is same.
